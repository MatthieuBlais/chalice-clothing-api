# Chalice clothing api

## 1. What is this?

This repository is a an API that can be deploy on AWS with API Gateway and Lambda functions.

This is just a personnal repository to use a code version control. I don't think it will be very useful to you, or only if you're looking for a project structure using chalice framework.

Chalice official documentation: https://github.com/aws/chalice


## 2. How to get started?

Clone this project and install chalice (check the official documentation). You will need some credentials (AWS credentials) and a valid database. Obviously, I don't share them here.

## 3. Where is the documentation?

As mentioned, this is a "private" repo. This api is developed in parallele of another project where the documentation is hosted.
